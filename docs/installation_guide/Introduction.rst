Introduction
============

This chapter will walk a user through the process of installing the :term:`SIMP`
server in a SIMP system. A SIMP system is one that includes, at a minimum, a SIMP
server with properly configured networking information and a working Puppet server.
Optionally, a SIMP system can also include one or more managed clients. The topics
related to client management are covered in :ref:`simp-user-guide`.

.. WARNING::
  There are default passwords present on the system that should be changed prior
  to deploying the system.

  **Please make sure that you change these passwords!**

  For a list of the passwords, see :ref:`ig-default-passwords`
