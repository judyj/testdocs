Meltdown and Spectre
====================

SIMP does not force users to update to kernels, or other system components,
that work around either :term:`Meltdown` or :term:`Spectre`. This is done to
not adversely affect production environments.

Please follow your vendor's instructions on mitigating these attacks on your
systems.

You can find additional information on the exploits at the
`Meltdown Attack website`_.

You find additional information on how automatic system updates work in
SIMP by referring to the :ref:`ug-sa-ga-nightly-updates` section of the
:ref:`simp-user-guide`.
