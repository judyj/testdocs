Diving Right In
---------------

The fastest way to get started with :term:`SIMP` is to use one of the following
two guides:

#. You need an ISO for bare metal or VM installation

   *  :ref:`gsg-installing_simp_from_an_iso`

#. You have an existing system

   *  :ref:`gsg-installing_simp_from_a_repository`

You should then follow the :ref:`simp-user-guide` to start configuring the
system.
