Installation Options
====================

.. TIP::

   Please take a look at the :ref:`faq` prior to installing SIMP. The most
   relevant questions for new users will always be at the top of the list.

If you are installing on a system with an existing operating system, you will
want to :ref:`install from a SIMP Repository
<gsg-installing_simp_from_a_repository>`. Otherwise, you will probably want to
:ref:`install from the ISO <gsg-installing_simp_from_an_iso>`, which configures
the disks and partitions to be compatible with most STIGs.

Once you're done setting up your environment, you should proceed to the
:ref:`simp-user-guide` for utilizing SIMP to its full potential.
