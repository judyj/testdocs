How To Generate a  Puppetfile
=============================

This section describes how to create a Puppetfile to be used by r10k
or code manager to deploy SIMP and site modules.  It assumes the user is
on the puppetserver.  It covers building from Local Repositories or using the
Internet repositories

.. Warning::

   Any module not listed in the ``Puppetfile`` will be deleted from the
   target environment's ``modules`` directory, when you use :term:`r10k` to
   deploy the modules.

.. contents::
   :local:

Generate the Puppetfile skeleton
--------------------------------

   .. code-block:: ruby

      simp puppetfile generate -s > Puppetfile

Edit the Puppetfile to include non-simp site modules
----------------------------------------------------

   Make sure the ``Puppetfile`` used to deploy from includes the following:

   * A line that includes the ``Puppetfile.simp`` which should look like:

     .. code-block:: ruby

        instance_eval(File.read(File.join(__dir__,"Puppetfile.simp")))

   * A line for each of your own modules.

     The SIMP :term:`CLI` can help identify local modules in an environment
     that need to be listed in the ``Puppetfile``, because they may not be under
     Git source control and, when removed by ``r10k``, may not be able to be
     readily restored.

     To generate a list of local modules in an environment (``production`` in
     this example) do the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        simp puppetfile generate --skeleton --local-modules production  > /tmp/Puppetfile

     This will generate ``/tmp/Puppetfile`` which has

     * a directive to include the file ``Puppetfile.simp``
     * a local entry for each module presently in the ``production``
       environment, that does not have a local, SIMP-managed Git repostory and
       does not appear to be managed by Git.


     The local entries will look like the following:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        mod 'module name', :local => true

     Verify that all modules with a local entry in ``/tmp/Puppetfile`` are in
     your environment's ``Puppetfile`` in one of the following forms:

     .. code-block:: yaml

         # a module that is not a Git repository and resides in the ``modules`` directory
         mod 'site',
           :local => true

         # a Git repository that resides in a directory on the Puppet server
         mod 'mymodule',
          :git => 'file:///usr/share/mymodules/mymodule',
          :tag => '1.1.1'

         #  a Git repository on a remote server
         mod 'mysrvmod',
           :git => 'https://gitserver.my.domain/mygitproject/mysrvmod.git',
           :tag => '1.0.1'

     .. Note::

        Any modules on the local system (ones that use the
        ``:local => true`` directive), should be converted to a Git repository.
        This will ensure that if r10k removes them because of an error in the
        Puppetfile they can easily be restored from the Git repository.

Generate the Puppetfile.simp file
---------------------------------

Using local SIMP git repositories
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

     Make sure all the SIMP module RPMs are installed using yum
     that you want to use and then run:

     .. code-block:: bash

        simp puppetfile generate > Puppetfile.simp

Using SIMP internet repositories
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

     - Download the ``Puppetfile`` used to create a SIMP ISO for a specific release
       from the SIMP `simp-core repository`_. This example uses the
       SIMP ``6.4.0-0`` release.

       .. code-block:: bash

          curl -o Puppetfile.simp https://github.com/simp/simp-core/blob/6.4.0-0/Puppetfile.pinned

     - Manually edit the ``Puppetfile.simp`` to remove components that are not Puppet
       modules, by deleting all lines up to and including
       ``moduledir  'src/puppet/modules'``.

     - Optionally, edit the ``Puppetfile.simp`` to remove any non-core SIMP
       modules that are packaged with the ``simp-extras`` RPM, that are not needed.
       The list of the SIMP extra modules can be obtained  by examining the RPM
       requirements of the ``simp-extras`` RPM as follows:

       .. code-block:: bash

          yum deplist simp-extras


Copy the Puppetfile and Puppetfile.simp to top level of the environment
directory or the top level of the control repo.
