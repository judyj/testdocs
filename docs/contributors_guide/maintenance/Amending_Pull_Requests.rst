Amending Changes to Submitted Pull Requests
===========================================

.. NOTE::

   It is recommended that all SIMP Maintainers use the `hub`_ Git extensions
   and all examples in this section will expect that `hub`_ is installed and
   ready for use.

#. Clone the source repo:

   * ``git clone https://github.com/simp/simp-doc doc``

     .. IMPORTANT::

        We use ``git clone`` instead of ``hub clone`` so that we can't
        accidentally push to the main SIMP repositories. While we have
        `protected branches`_ for the critical components, one wrong command
        and and life can get unpleasant.

#. Pull down the pull request (PR) as found on the GitHub GUI. The local branch
   should match the branch in the PR (for example, branch SIMP-XXXX):

   * ``hub checkout https://github.com/simp/simp-doc/pull/9999 SIMP-XXXX``

#. Review the code or make your additional changes

   * ``HACK HACK HACK``

#. Add a new commit with your changes:

   * ``git commit -a -m "I made the docs better"``

#. Set up the target repo for a push:

   * ``hub remote set-url -p jeefberkey``

#. Push your new commit to the feature branch of the **owner** of the pull
   request.  In this example, the owner is `jeefberkey`, and the feature branch
   name is `SIMP-XXXX`: ``hub push jeefberkey HEAD:SIMP-XXXX``

#. The pull request has been updated, and participants have received an email
