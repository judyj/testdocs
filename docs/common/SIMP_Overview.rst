The System Integrity Management Platform (:term:`SIMP`) is an
:term:`Open Source` framework designed around the concept that individuals and
organizations should not need to repeat the work of automating the basic
components of their operating system infrastructure.

Expanding upon this philosophy, SIMP also aims to take care of routine policy
compliance to include :term:`NIST 800-53`, :term:`FIPS` 140-2, the
:term:`DISA STIG`, and the :term:`SCAP Security Guide`.

By using the :term:`Puppet` automation stack, SIMP is working toward the
concept of a self-healing infrastructure that, when used with a consistent
configuration management process, will allow users to have confidence that
their systems not only start in compliance but remain in compliance over time.

Finally, SIMP has a goal of remaining flexible enough to properly maintain your
operational infrastructure. To this end, where possible, the SIMP components
are written to allow all security-related capabilities to be easily adjusted to
meet the needs of individual applications.
