Welcome to the SIMP documentation!
==================================

This is the documentation for the |simp_version| release of SIMP, which is
compatible with the |el_version| release of CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL).  This guide will walk a user through the process of installing
and managing a :term:`SIMP` system.  It also provides a mapping of security
features to security requirements, which can be used to document a system's
security conformance.
